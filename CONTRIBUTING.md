# Contributing to Hanko

Thank you for considering contributing to Hanko. We are excited to welcome you aboard! ðŸš€

Please take some time to read this guide to understand contributing best practices for Hanko.

Big thanks for helping us make Hanko even better. ðŸ¤©

## Developing

The development branch is `main`. This is the branch that all pull requests should be made against.

### Prerequisites

[Go (v1.18+)](https://go.dev/doc/install)

[Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/)

### Set up

Clone the repo into a public GitHub repository or [fork the repo](https://github.com/teamhanko/hanko/fork).
   
   ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/<github_username>/hanko.git
   ```
  

## Running Backend

> **Note** If you just want to jump right into the experience of passkeys and passcodes, head over to the
> [quickstart guide](../quickstart/README.md).

To get the Hanko backend up and running you need to:

### Run a database

The following databases are currently supported:

- PostgreSQL
- MySQL

#### Postgres

Use Docker to run a container based on the official [Postgres](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres) image:

```shell
docker run --name=postgres \
-e POSTGRES_USER=<DB_USER> \
-e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=<DB_PASSWORD> \
-e POSTGRES_DB=<DB_DATABASE> \
-p <DB_PORT>:5432 \
-d postgres
```

or use the [official binary packages](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) to install and run
a Postgres instance.

#### MySQL

Use Docker to run a container based on the official [MySQL](https://hub.docker.com/_/mysql) image:

```shell
docker run --name=mysql \
-e MYSQL_USER=<DB_USER> \
-e MYSQL_PASSWORD=<DB_PASSWORD> \
-e MYSQL_DATABASE=<DB_DATABASE> \
-e MYSQL_RANDOM_ROOT_PASSWORD=true \
-p <DB_PORT>:3306 \
-d mysql:latest
```

or follow the official [installation instructions](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-getting-started/en/#mysql-getting-started-installing) to install and run
a MySQL instance.

### Configure database access

Open the `config.yaml` file in the `backend/config` or create your own `*.yaml` file and add the following:

```yaml
database:
  user: <DB_USER>
  password: <DB_PASSWORD>
  host: localhost # change this if the DB is not running on localhost, esp. in a production setting
  port: <DB_PORT>
  database: <DB_DATABASE>
  dialect: <DB_DIALECT> # depending on your choice of DB: postgres, mysql
```

Replace `<DB_USER>`, `<DB_PASSWORD>`, `<DB_PORT>`, `<DB_DATABASE>` with the values used in your running
DB instance (cf. the Docker commands above used for running the DB containers) and replace `<DB_DIALECT>` with
the DB of your choice.

### Apply Database migrations

Before you can start and use the service you need to run the database migrations:

#### Docker

```shell
docker run --mount type=bind,source=<PATH-TO-CONFIG-FILE>,target=/config/config.yaml -p 8000:8000 -it ghcr.io/teamhanko/hanko:latest migrate up
```

> **Note** The `<PATH-TO-CONFIG-FILE>` must be an absolute path to your config file created above.

#### From source

First build the Hanko backend. The only prerequisite is to have Go (v1.18+) [installed](https://go.dev/doc/install)
on your computer.

```shell
go generate ./...
go build -a -o hanko main.go
```

This command will create an executable with the name `hanko`, which then can be used to apply the database migrations
and start the Hanko backend.

To apply the migrations, run:

```shell
./hanko migrate up --config <PATH-TO-CONFIG-FILE>
```

> **Note** The path to the config file can be relative or absolute.


### Run and configure an SMTP server

The Hanko backend requires an SMTP server to send out mails containing
passcodes (e.g. for the purpose of email verification, password recovery).

For local development purposes you can use, e.g., [Mailslurper](https://www.mailslurper.com/).
Follow the official [installation](https://github.com/mailslurper/mailslurper/wiki/Getting-Started) instructions or
use an (inofficial) [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/marcopas/docker-mailslurper) to get it up and running:

```shell
docker run --name=mailslurper -it -p 2500:2500 -p 8080:8080 -p 8085:8085 @marcopas/docker-mailslurper
```

where in this case
- `2500` is the SMTP port of the service
- `8080` is the port for the GUI application for managing mails
- `8085` is the port for the [API](https://github.com/mailslurper/mailslurper/wiki/API-Guide) service for managing mails

When using the above Docker command to run a Mailslurper container, it does not configure
a user/password, so a minimal configuration in your configuration file (`backend/config/config.yaml` or
your own `*.yaml` file) could contain the following:

```yaml
passcode:
  email:
    from_address: no-reply@example.com
    from_name: Example Application
  smtp:
    host: localhost
    port: 2500
```

To ensure that passcode emails also contain a proper subject header, configure a service
name:

```yaml
service:
  name: Example Authentication Service
```

In a production setting you would rather use a self-hosted SMTP server or a managed service like AWS SES. In that case
you need to supply the `passcode.smtp.host`, `passcode.smtp.port` as well as the `passcode.smtp.user`,
`passcode.smtp.password` settings according to your server/service settings.

> **Note** The `passcode.smtp.host` configuration entry is required for the service to start up.
> Only a check for a non-empty string value will be performed. Also: SMTP-connection related values are not
> verified, i.e. the application may start but no emails will be sent and your users might not be able to log in if
> the provided values do not describe an existing SMTP server.

### Configure JSON Web Key Set generation

The API uses [JSON Web Tokens](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7519.html) (JWTs) for
[authentication](https://docs.hanko.io/api/public#section/Authentication).
JWTs are verified using [JSON Web Keys](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7517) (JWK).
JWKs are created internally by setting `secrets.keys` options in the
configuration file (`backend/config/config.yaml` or your own `*.yaml` file):

```yaml
secrets:
  keys:
    - <CHANGE-ME>
```

> **Note**  at least one `secrets.keys` entry must be provided and each entry must be a random generated string at least 16 characters long.

Keys secrets are used to en- and decrypt the JWKs which get used to sign the JWTs.
For every key a JWK is generated, encrypted with the key and persisted in the database.

The Hanko backend API publishes public cryptographic keys as a JWK set through the `.well-known/jwks.json`
[endpoint](https://docs.hanko.io/api/public#tag/.well-known/operation/getJwks) to enable clients to verify token
signatures.

### Configure WebAuthn

Passkeys are based on the [Web Authentication API](https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-2/#web-authentication-api).
In order to create and login with passkeys, the Hanko backend must be provided information about
the [WebAuthn Relying Party](https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-2/#webauthn-relying-party).

For most use cases, you just need the domain of your web application that uses the Hanko backend. Set
`webauthn.relying_party.id` to the domain and set `webauthn.relying_party.origin` to the domain _including_ the
protocol.

> **Important**: If you are hosting your web application on a non-standard HTTP port (i.e. `80`) you also have to
> include this in the origin setting.

#### Local development example

When developing locally, the Hanko backend defaults to:

```yaml
webauthn:
  relying_party:
    id: "localhost"
    display_name: "Hanko Authentication Service"
    origins:
      - "http://localhost"
```

so no further configuration changes need to be made to your configuration file.

#### Production Examples

When you have a website hosted at `example.com` and you want to add a login to it that will be available
at `https://example.com/login`, the WebAuthn config would look like this:

```yaml
webauthn:
  relying_party:
    id: "example.com"
    display_name: "Example Project"
    origins:
      - "https://example.com"
```

If the login should be available at `https://login.example.com` instead, then the WebAuthn config would look like this:

```yaml
webauthn:
  relying_party:
    id: "login.example.com"
    display_name: "Example Project"
    origins:
      - "https://login.example.com"
```

Given the above scenario, you still may want to bind your users WebAuthn credentials to `example.com` if you plan to
add other services on other subdomains later that should be able to use existing credentials. Another reason can be if
you want to have the option to move your login from `https://login.example.com` to `https://example.com/login` at some
point. Then the WebAuthn config would look like this:

```yaml
webauthn:
  relying_party:
    id: "example.com"
    display_name: "Example Project"
    origins:
      - "https://login.example.com"
```

### Configure CORS

Because the backend and your application(s) consuming backend API most likely have different origins, i.e.
scheme (protocol), hostname (domain), and port part of the URL are different, you need to configure
Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) and specify your application(s) as allowed origins:

```yaml
server:
  public:
    cors:
      allow_origins:
        - https://example.com
```

When you include a wildcard `*` origin you need to set `unsafe_wildcard_origin_allowed: true`:

```yaml
server:
  public:
    cors:
      allow_origins:
        - "*"
      unsafe_wildcard_origin_allowed: true
```

Wildcard `*` origins can lead to cross-site attacks and when you include a `*` wildcard origin,
we want to make sure, that you understand what you are doing, hence this flag.

> **Note** In most cases, the `allow_origins` list here should contain the same entries as the `webauthn.relying_party.origins` list. Only when you have an Android app you will have an extra entry (`android:apk-key-hash:...`) in the `webauthn.relying_party.origins` list.

### Start the backend

The Hanko backend consists of a public and an administrative API (currently providing user management
endpoints). These can be started separately or in a single command.

#### Start the public API

##### Docker

```shell
docker run --mount type=bind,source=<PATH-TO-CONFIG-FILE>,target=/config/config.yaml -p 8000:8000 -it ghcr.io/teamhanko/hanko:latest serve public
```

> **Note** The `<PATH-TO-CONFIG-FILE>` must be an absolute path to your config file created above.

The service is now available at `localhost:8000`.

`8000` is the default port for the public API. It can be [customized](./docs/Config.md) in the configuration through
the `server.public.address` option.

##### From source

```shell
go generate ./...
go build -a -o hanko main.go
```

Then run:
```shell
./hanko serve public --config <PATH-TO-CONFIG-FILE>
```

The service is now available at `localhost:8000`.

#### Start the admin API

In the usage section above we only started the public API. Use the command below to start the admin API. The default
port is `8001`, but can be [customized](./docs/Config.md) in the configuration through the
`server.admin.address` option.

```shell
serve admin
```

> **Warning** The admin API must be protected by an access management system.

##### Start both public and admin API

Use this command to start the public and admin API together:

```shell
serve all
```

# Style guidelines

## Go

Go files should be [formatted](https://go.dev/blog/gofmt) according to gofmt's rules.

```
# single file
go fmt path/to/changed/file.go

# all files, e.g. in 'backend' directory
go fmt ./...
```
